## Turning Conversations into Actions

Web conferencing and online meetings have become the new work culture nowadays. But somewhere along the lines, we often keep missing the crux of the discussions in these online meetings, and here comes our solution - **SmartSummary**. It is your easy to use online meeting assistant that backs you up with automated meeting minutes in every conversation. It will help you save time on board meetings, team management, and customer support such that you just focus on the conversation and never miss whatâ€™s important.

StandNote also fits into the current online education scenario where most of the classes take place over online platforms like Google Meet and Zoom. We help students with quick and concise notes that help them to revise and memorize the concepts better.
